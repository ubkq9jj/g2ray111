# g2ray

A self-hosted proxy setup that runs inside GitHub Codespaces.

## Quick Start

1. Fork this repository to your own account
2. Navigate to your fork and open the **Codespaces** tab under the Code button
3. Create a new codespace on the main branch
4. Wait a few minutes for the environment to build and initialize
5. Your connection string will appear in the terminal once setup is complete

## Connecting

Grab the link printed in the terminal and paste it into any compatible client (v2rayNG, Nekobox, etc.).

## Usage Limits

GitHub Codespaces provides **120 core-hours/month** on the free tier. Since this config uses 2 cores, that translates to roughly 60 hours per month. Make sure to stop your codespace when not actively using it to avoid burning through your quota.

## Compatibility

Works on most networks that aren't aggressively blocking GitHub infrastructure. If the default region doesn't work for you, try creating the codespace in a different datacenter.
